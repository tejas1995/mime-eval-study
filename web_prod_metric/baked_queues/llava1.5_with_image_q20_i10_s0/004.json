    "predicted_answer": "Visibility",
    "prediction_is_correct": 1,
    "generated_rationale": "The person's vest is yellow to make them more visible to others, especially in low light conditions or crowded areas. Wearing bright colors, such as yellow, increases the chances of being seen by drivers, pedestrians, and other road users, reducing the risk of accidents and ensuring the safety of the person wearing the vest.",

    "generated_rationale": "The gray colored residue seen on the outer part of the middle of the surfboard is wax. Wax is applied to the surface of the surfboard to provide grip and prevent the surfer's feet from slipping off the board while riding a wave. Over time, the wax can wear off and leave a residue on the surface of the surfboard.",

    "prediction_is_correct": 0,
    "generated_rationale": "The device the boy is holding is powered by electricity. This can be inferred from the fact that the boy is playing a video game, which typically requires electricity to function. Video game consoles, such as the Nintendo Wii, are connected to an electrical outlet to receive power. Additionally, the boy is holding a Wii remote, which is an electronic device that requires electricity to function. Therefore, the answer to the question is electricity.",

    "predicted_answer": "Thermoregulation",
    "prediction_is_correct": 0,
    "generated_rationale": "The zebra's stripes serve as a form of thermoregulation. The black and white stripes create an optical illusion known as \"motion dazzle,\" which makes it difficult for predators to single out an individual zebra when they are in a group. This helps protect the zebra from attacks by predators such as lions and hyenas. The stripes also help in regulating the zebra's body temperature, as the black stripes absorb more sunlight and heat than the white stripes, creating small-scale air currents that help dissipate heat from the zebra's body.",

    "generated_rationale": "The men wearing yellow vests are likely wearing them for increased visibility. Wearing brightly colored clothing, such as yellow vests, can make individuals more noticeable to others, especially in low-light conditions or crowded environments. This increased visibility can help prevent accidents and ensure the safety of both the individuals wearing the vests and those around them.",

    "generated_rationale": "The buses with blue trim are most likely assembled at a stadium. This can be inferred from the image, which shows a large number of buses parked next to each other in a parking lot. Stadiums often host large events and gatherings, requiring a significant number of buses to transport attendees to and from the venue. The fact that these buses have blue trim suggests that they may belong to a specific transportation company or organization associated with the stadium, further supporting the idea that they are assembled at the stadium.",

This can be inferred from the fact that the car's headlights are on, indicating that it is moving in the opposite direction.
